title: Shared Responsibility Model
---

The Shared Responsibility Model defines the security and operational responsibilities between Upstash and our customers when using Upstash Redis. This model ensures clarity in who is responsible for what aspects of security, compliance, and operations.

## Overview

Upstash Redis is a serverless database service that provides Redis® API compatibility with automatic scaling, high availability, and enterprise-grade security features. The shared responsibility model divides responsibilities into three main categories:

- **Upstash Responsibilities**: Infrastructure, platform, and service-level security
- **Customer Responsibilities**: Data, application, and access management
- **Shared Responsibilities**: Configuration, monitoring, and incident response

## Responsibility Matrix

| Category | Upstash | Customer | Shared |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Infrastructure Security** | ✅ Physical security, network infrastructure, DDoS protection, hardware maintenance | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Platform Security** | ✅ OS security, Redis updates, container security, infrastructure monitoring | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Service Availability** | ✅ 99.99% SLA (Prod Pack), multi-region replication, auto-scaling, disaster recovery | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Data Encryption** | ✅ TLS in transit, encryption at rest (Prod Pack), key management | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Compliance** | ✅ SOC 2 (Prod Pack), GDPR, HIPAA (Enterprise) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Data Management** | ❌ | ✅ Data classification, retention policies, quality controls | ❌ |
| **Application Security** | ❌ | ✅ Secure development, input validation, authentication, client-side encryption | ❌ |
| **Access Control** | ❌ | ✅ Redis ACL, user permissions, credential management, MFA | ❌ |
| **Network Security** | ❌ | ✅ IP allowlist, network segmentation, client security | ❌ |
| **Security Configuration** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Feature enablement, ACL setup, security policies |
| **Monitoring** | ✅ Infrastructure monitoring, incident response | ✅ Application monitoring, custom metrics | ✅ Performance monitoring, security monitoring |
| **Incident Response** | ✅ Infrastructure incidents, service restoration | ✅ Application incidents, data incidents | ✅ Incident coordination, root cause analysis |

## Managing healthcare data

You can use Upstash Redis to store and process Protected Health Information (PHI). You are responsible for the following:

- **Signing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with Upstash. Email [support@upstash.com](mailto:support@upstash.com) to get started.
- **Marking specific databases as HIPAA databases** and addressing security issues raised by the advisor.
- **Ensuring MFA is enabled** on all Upstash accounts.
  - Enforce MFA as a requirement to access the organization
- **Enabling Prod Pack** which provides encryption at rest and advanced security features.
- **Configuring IP allowlist** to restrict database access to authorized networks.
- **Complying with encryption requirements** in the HIPAA Security Rule. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit by Upstash. You can consider encrypting the data at your application layer.
- **Not using public endpoints** to process PHI.
- **Not transferring databases** to a non-HIPAA organization.

For more information on the shared responsibilities and rules under HIPAA, review the [HIPAA compliance responsibilities document](/common/help/compliance).
